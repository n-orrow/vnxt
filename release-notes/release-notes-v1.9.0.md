# Release v1.9.0

Released: 2026-02-17 at 12:00:52
Author: n-orrow

## Changes
feat: auto-generate release notes on --publish with context prompt, timestamp and author

## Release Notes
Having some nice chunky fleshed out release notes whenever I publish is probably a good thing for users. This update will ask users to add context (not required) to when publishing. This will also automatically update the changelog.md and (in the near future) be reflected on vnxt.dev with a section that shows the latest release notes.

## Installation
```bash
npm install vnxt@1.9.0
```

## Full Changelog
See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for complete version history.
