# Changelog

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-12
- patch: updated vnxtrc.json to match my current settings - use my settings or else nout tbh, but still, just use them


## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-12
- minor: added shorthand 'vx' command because vnxt is an awkward arrangement to type (all left hand and yucky)


## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-12
- major: refactoring project to vnxt from vnxt - other similar tools exist with that name
